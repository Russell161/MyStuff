            <h1 class="header-msg">This semi final game took place in the first ever College Football Playoff between powerhouse Alabama and blueblood Ohio State. Many believed that Ohio State did not deserve to be in the playoff and would get destroyed by Alabama. This all time classic ended in an Ohio State win with one of the most iconic plays in the history of the game cementing the victory for Ohio State and catapulting them into the National Championship game that they would eventually win.</h1>

                <p class="para-color">With 7:52 left in the third quarter of the National Championship game, Ohio State had jumped out to a 31-7 lead over Notre Dame. Many thought the game over but watched as Notre Dame marched on a gritty 16-0 run, and closed the game to within 8 points. 2 minutes now stood between Ohio State and their 9th National Championship. Ohio State had 3rd and 11 from their own 34 yard line and most people expected them to simply play conservative, punt the ball, and try to win the game on defense. But what those people didn’t realize is that star wide receiver Jeremiah Smith was on the field. Quarterback Will Howard took the snap, took a quick two step drop, and heaved the ball downfield. As the camera panned, spectators in the stadium erupted as Jeremiah Smith caught the ball, effectively sealing Ohio State’s new status as Kings of College Football. </p>

                <p class="para-color">The title “Kings of College Football” often carries many difficult or negative aspects, including roster turnover, coaching changes, as well as expert analysts and fans alike wondering if this team genuinely deserved this win. But none of these anchors weighed down the Ohio State players and staff as they hoisted the National Championship trophy. As the gold confetti drifted down, joyful players hugged family and friends. In a couple days, or maybe weeks, they would need to fall back down to reality, but no one was ready that night as celebrations ranged from mild Atlanta to freezing cold Columbus, Ohio. </p>
